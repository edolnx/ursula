 # SSL Engine Options:
 # Set various options for the SSL engine.
 # o FakeBasicAuth:
 # Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation. This means that
 # the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control. The
 # user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
 # Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
 # file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
 # o ExportCertData:
 # This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
 # SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
 # server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
 # authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
 # into CGI scripts.
 # o StdEnvVars:
 # This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
 # Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
 # because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
 # useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
 # exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
 # o StrictRequire:
 # This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
 # under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
 # and no other module can change it.
 # o OptRenegotiate:
 # This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
 # directives are used in per-directory context.

 # SSL Protocol Adjustments:
 # The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
 # approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
 # the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
 # approach you can use one of the following variables:
 # o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
 # This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
 # SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received. This violates
 # the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
 # this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
 # mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
 # o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
 # This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
 # SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
 # alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
 # practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
 # this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
 # works correctly.
 # Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
 # keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
 # keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
 # Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
 # their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
 # "force-response-1.0" for this.
